  <!-- Introduction -->
  <div class="mb-4">
    <p class="text-secondary" style="line-height: 1.8;">
      Ford Vietnam was established in 1995 as a joint venture between Ford Motor Company (USA) and Sông Công Diesel Company. We are proud to be the first American automotive investor in Vietnam after normalization of diplomatic relations. With over $200 million USD in investment, our commitment remains stronger than ever.
    </p>
    <p class="text-secondary" style="line-height: 1.8;">
      Our operations include a state-of-the-art assembly plant in Hải Dương, 43 dealerships nationwide, and a workforce of over 1,200 employees. In 2020, we expanded our production capacity to 40,000 vehicles annually, meeting growing demand for high-quality, locally-produced Ford vehicles.
